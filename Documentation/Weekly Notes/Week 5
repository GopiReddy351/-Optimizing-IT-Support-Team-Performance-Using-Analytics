In Data Visualization Data has 3 Types
These 3 are Important Based on Table Data calculatons.
1)Categorical Data:
It uses Bar chart when comparing data,Pie chart uses proportions in categorical Data.
Whenever you Visualizing categorical Data There must be no more than 5 to 6categories.
It is too complex Sum of all proportions = 100
2)Numerical Data: The data contains Numerical Values in the Table.
3)Time Waste Data:
In this Time series is calculated by line graph.
Time attribute:monthly/Yearly sales,you can create line graph and connect it to the bar graph,
because bar graph is optimal.

Views are three types in Data Visualization.
Table View, Model View, Report View
We can't Connect one Table to another Table until a same commen column have.
Data Modeling: It is also known as Schematic modeling.
It is Structuring your Data  using tools like PowerBI.
It is used in Multiple Table working Time.
The Main Table contains only UserId's only it is also known as fact Table.
The other small tables contains Indetail Information known as Dimension Tables.
Whenever we want to make a connection(Figjam) between two tables must present same column.
Relationships have 4 types:
Many to One (* + 1) Many columns in Table-A connect to one Matched column in Table-B. 
One to Many (1 + *) One column in Table-B connects to Many columns Which Matches in Table-A.
Many to Many (* + *) Many columns in Table-A connects to Many columns Which Matches in Table-B.
One to One (1 + 1) One column in Table-A connects to One matched column in Table-B.
Star schema : It is make connection between Fact table and Dimension Table.

KPI'S - Keep Performance Indicator:
It is used for better Visualization.
it is in Numerical form.
Kpi's are critical numbers used to track progress towards a goal.
Cards:it gives quick glimnce of Numerical Value
Database KEY's:
Primary Key:It is a main key unique and doesn't contain duplicates.
Foreign key:It have many duplicates.

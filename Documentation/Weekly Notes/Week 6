DAX Formulas
 DAX: Data Analysis Expressions
 Sigma(Σ): This shows numeric data / measurable values
 DAX helps create a measure.
 Measure: It is a calculation.

Note: 
 A measure is better than standard values because it has greater control and is easier to format.
 Make sure all the tables are connected.
 A measure will not be visible in the table view.
 A Measure is a Scalar Value.

Task: Create a simple DAX measure.
DAX Formula: Total Tickets = COUNTROWS('Fact_Ticket')

 Implicit Functions: Functions that are available by default in Power BI (SUM).
 Explicit Functions: Functions that are created externally (DAX).

 Base Measure: A measure created from a column existing in the table.
 Composite Measure: A measure created using different measures.

 Calculate Function: It allows applying multiple filters on the same measure.
 Slicer: Is used to filter data. It consists of multiple types.

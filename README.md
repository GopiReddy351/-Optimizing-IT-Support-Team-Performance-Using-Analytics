# Optimizing-IT-Support-Team-Performance-Using-Analytics
Modern IT support teams handle large volumes of service requests with varying priorities, service-level agreements (SLAs), and customer expectations. Without systematic analysis, inefficiencies such as delayed ticket resolution, uneven workload distribution, frequent SLA breaches, and declining customer satisfaction often go unnoticed.
This project focuses on optimizing IT support team performance using analytics by transforming raw ticket data into actionable insights. Through Python-based data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI–driven visualization, the analysis evaluates key performance indicators such as resolution time, SLA compliance, agent productivity, ticket backlog, and customer satisfaction.
The objective is to enable data-driven decision-making that helps IT managers improve operational efficiency, balance workloads, reduce resolution delays, and enhance overall service quality. The outcome is an interactive dashboard and insight-backed recommendations that support continuous performance improvement within IT support operations.
